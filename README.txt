A Pen created at CodePen.io. You can find this one at https://codepen.io/robinsavemark/pen/GpxQZV.

 Made a template with a menu using Bootstrap, Animate.css, Wow.js. 

HTML, CSS (LESS) and of course JavaScript/jQuery

Modal contains client-side validation, only on "Credit card"-info though, where I'm only checking the digits. Depending on which "sign up plan" you choose, it will also know that. If you choose "free", the credit card inputs will not be shown etc...

Well, I think it's pretty cool.

Plugins: Typed.js, Wow.js, matchHeight.js
